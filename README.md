# Prisoner's dilemma 

A match pitting different strategies for the [prisoner's dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) against each other. 

The code uses a [genetic algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) to evolve strategies that beat the universal TitForTat (a.k.a. Copycat) strategy, as long as a "mistake" probability is high enough. 1:1000 is normally sufficient.

For an excellent introduction to the prisoner's dilemma and its relevance see the interactive [Evolution of Trust](http://ncase.me/trust/) site.
